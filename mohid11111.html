            <article>
                <h3>Resources from the Ocean</h3>
                <p>Oceans are a vast source of resources that are vital to human life and the global economy. Marine resources include fish, oil and gas reserves, minerals, and renewable energy sources such as wind and tidal power.</p>
                <p>Fish and other marine organisms are crucial for food security, providing protein to billions of people worldwide. Sustainable fishing practices are essential to maintaining this resource for future generations.</p>
                <p>Oil and gas reserves beneath the ocean floor are significant sources of energy. Offshore drilling platforms are used to extract these resources, which play a critical role in the global energy supply.</p>
                <p>Minerals such as manganese, cobalt, and rare earth elements are found in ocean beds. These minerals are essential for manufacturing electronics, renewable energy technologies, and various industrial processes.</p>
                <p>Renewable energy from the ocean includes wind farms located offshore and tidal energy harnessed from the movement of tides. These energy sources are vital for reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change.</p>
                <p>Marine resources also have medicinal potential, with many marine organisms producing compounds that are used in pharmaceuticals. Ongoing research continues to explore the ocean's potential for new medicines.</p>
